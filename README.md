# Result


## Report 
- More infomation about the model architecture as well as my full approach to this task can be find in "final report" folder

## State Dict
- The best model and optim state dict can be find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14GILtBzzuLLRJ9W_hOfM-9iDHBC-m6PW?usp=sharing)
. 
- **I** trained the model for roughly 3 hours. So if you want better result, feel free to use it as a good initial weights.
